The "Programming Samples" sub repo has several data structures and order to be followed and the example prorgamming in each data strucutre is as follows:

1. Array
  - One Dimensional Array: Start by creating and understanding basic one-dimensional arrays.
  - Two Dimensional Array: After mastering one-dimensional arrays, move to two-dimensional arrays for more complex data structures.
  - InsertToArray: Learn how to insert elements into arrays once you understand the structure.
  - DeleteArray: Understand how to remove elements from an array.
  - SearchArray: Learn how to search for elements within arrays after knowing how to insert and delete.
  - Circular Array: Explore circular arrays, which have elements that wrap around the end.
  - Circular Resizable Array: Lastly, work with a circular resizable array, which combines the concepts of a circular array with dynamic resizing.

2. ArrayList
  - AddElementsToArrayList: Start by learning how to add elements to the ArrayList.
  - AccessElementsFromArrayList: Once elements are added, understand how to access them.
  - ChangeElementArrayList: Learn how to modify elements within the ArrayList.
  - IterateArrayList: After learning how to add, access, and change elements, explore how to iterate through the ArrayList.
  - RemoveElementsArrayList: Learn how to remove elements after adding, modifying, and iterating through them.
  - SortArrayList: Sorting an ArrayList (general).
  - SortArrayListNumbers: Sorting an ArrayList specifically for numbers.
  - ArrayListToArray: Convert the ArrayList to an array once the operations are complete.

3. Linked List
  - CreateLinkedList: Start by creating the linked list structure.
  - UpdateLinkedList: Modify or update the linked list as necessary after its creation.
  - LinkedListSize: Check the size of the linked list at any point.
  - GetFromLinkedList: Retrieve data from specific nodes in the list.
  - LinkedListToArray: Convert the linked list to an array if you need a different format.
  - RemoveFirst: If you want to remove the first node from the list.
  - RemoveLast: To remove the last node in the list.
  - RemoveFromLinkedList: To remove a specific node, likely by value or position.

4. Doubly LinkedList
  - DoublyLinkedListInsertBeginning: Start by learning how to insert elements at the beginning of a doubly linked list to establish its structure.
  - DoublyLinkedListEndBeginning: Follow by learning to insert at the end of the list for completeness in inserting nodes.
  - DoublyLinkedListInsertSpecific: Next, understand how to insert elements at specific positions in the list.
  - DoublyLinkedListTraversal: Learn to traverse the list after mastering insertion, which helps in visualizing the structure.
  - DoublyLinkedListFindLength: Understand how to calculate the length of the list to keep track of the number of nodes.
  - DoublyLinkedListSearch: Learn how to search for elements within the list once you can traverse and manage the size.
  - DoublyLinkedListDeletionBeginning: Start deletion operations with removing the first node.
  - DoublyLinkedListEndBeginning: Learn to delete the last node after understanding how to delete from the beginning.
  - DoublyLinkedListDeletionSpecific: Lastly, understand how to remove nodes at specific positions, completing your knowledge of deletion operations.

5. Hash Map and Hash Set
  - Create Hash Map: Learn how to create and initialize a HashMap.
  - Hash Map PutAll Method: Understand how to add multiple elements to the HashMap in one go.
  - Hash Map PutIfAbsent Method: Learn how to insert elements only if they are not already present.
  - Hash Map GetOrDefault: Learn how to retrieve values safely, with a default return value if the key doesnâ€™t exist.
  - Hash Map Remove Element: Understand how to remove elements from the HashMap.
  - Hash Map Clear Elements: Learn how to remove all elements from the HashMap.
  - Hash Map Size: Learn how to check the number of key-value pairs in the HashMap.
  - Hash Map Key Set: Learn how to retrieve all the keys from the HashMap.
  - Hash Map Value Set: Learn how to retrieve all the values from the HashMap.
  - Hash Map For Each Method: Learn how to iterate over the HashMap using forEach.
  - Hash Map Compute ifAbsent: Learn how to compute values if a key is not already present.
  - Hash Map Compute Method: Understand how to compute values based on existing key-value pairs.
  - Hash Map Merge: Learn how to merge existing values in the map with new ones.
  - Hash Map Replace Method: Learn how to replace values in the HashMap if a key is already present.
  - Hash Map ReplaceAll Method: Learn how to replace all values based on some logic.
  - Hash Set Add Elements: Start learning HashSets by understanding how to add elements.
  - Hash Set Contains: Learn how to check if an element exists in a HashSet.
  - Hash Set Data Type: Learn how to work with different data types in HashSets.
  - Print Hash Map: Learn how to print the entire HashMap for debugging or verification.
