# Data Structure (Java)

This repository contains materials for the **Data Structures** course, focusing on Java implementations. Data structures are crucial for organizing and storing information efficiently in computer programs. The course covers various fundamental data structures including linked lists, arrays, stacks, queues, strings, trees, graphs, search trees, heaps, hash tables, and B-trees.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Lec Materials
This folder contains lecture materials, including PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and any other resources used throughout the course. 

### 2. Programming Samples
This folder contains Java programming examples that illustrate the implementation of various data structures. These examples are designed to help you understand the practical applications of the concepts discussed in the lectures.

## Course Syllabus

- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists
- **Arrays**: Dynamic arrays, multi-dimensional arrays
- **Stacks**: Implementation using arrays and linked lists
- **Queues**: Circular queues, priority queues, dequeues
- **Strings**: String manipulation techniques, substring search algorithms
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, B-trees
- **Graphs**: Representation using adjacency lists and matrices, graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- **Heaps**: Min-heaps, max-heaps, heap sort
- **Hash Tables**: Open addressing, chaining, hash functions
- **B-Trees**: B-trees, B+ trees

## How to Use This Repository

- Navigate to the **Lec Materials** folder to access lecture slides, notes, and other resources.
- Explore the **Programming Samples** folder to review and practice Java implementations of the data structures discussed in the course.
